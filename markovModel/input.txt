Can't you see that it's just rainin'
Ain't no need to go outside
But baby
You hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song is meant to keep you
Doin' what you're supposed to
Wakin' up too early
Maybe we could sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like its the weekend now
We could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just rainin'
There ain't no need to go outside
Just maybe
Halaka ukulele mama made a baby
Really don't mind the practice
Cause you're my little lady
Lady lady love me
Cause I love to lay here lazy
We could close the curtains
Pretend like there's no world outside
We could pretend it all the time
And can't you see that it's just rainin'
There ain't no need to go outside
Ain't no need ain't no need
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Can't you see can't you see
Rain all day and I don't mind
But the telephone's singing ringing
It's too early don't pick it up
We don't need to
We got everything we need right here
And everything we need is enough
Just so easy when the whole world fits inside of your arms
Do we really need to pay attention to the alarm
Wake up slow
Mmm wake up slow
But baby
You hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song is meant to keep you
From doin' what your supposed to
Wakin' up too early
Maybe we could sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now
We could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just rainin'
There ain't no need to go outside
Ain't no need, ain't no need
Rain all day and I really really really don't mind
Can't you see? Can't you see?
We gotta wake up slow
